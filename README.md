About
-----

Titan is a framework for instantiation of content management systems (CMS) and backend (REST-Like API) to creation of complex web applications. The **Titan Framework** proposal is to be a simple and complete development tool, allowing you to create robust applications quickly and easily.

Titan was developed and is maintained by the partnership between the [Software Engineering Laboratory (LEDES)](http://www.ledes.net) of the [Faculty of Computing (FACOM)](http://www.facom.ufms.br) of the [Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)](https://www.ufms.br) and the [Laboratory for Precision Livestock, Environment and Software Engineering (PLEASE Lab)](https://please.cnpgc.embrapa.br) of the [Embrapa Beef Cattle](https://www.embrapa.br/gado-de-corte) of the [Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa)](https://embrapa.br).

Getting Started
---------------

To create your project, use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
php composer.phar create-project titan-framework/instance path/to/local/folder
```

After install, start [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) box to run your application. For this, install first [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with it's Extension Pack.

**Warning!** Since version 6.0, the VirtualBox Guest Additions does not works properly anymore. To fix this issue, has a script `vagrant.sh` that need to run before `vagrant up` command.

```bash
cd path/to/local/folder
./vagrant.sh
vagrant up
```

Alternatively, you can run your application as a [Docker](https://docker.com) container:

```bash
cd path/to/local/folder
docker-compose up -d
```

In Vagrant (recomended to **development** environments) your Titan instance will running at **http://localhost:8090**. To access, use "**admin**" as login and password. You can access shell using SSH at localhost:2222. All e-mail messages is getted by [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), and you can access at **http://localhost:8025**. Now, you can modify the base-code to implement your requirements.

In Docker (recomended to **test**, **homologation** and **production** environments) edit ```docker-compose.yml``` file in root directory to set correct ports for your infrastructure.

More Information
----------------

Read [official documentation](http://www.titanframework.com/docs/preface/) and [Titan Cookbook](https://github.com/titan-framework/docs/raw/master/Cookbook.pdf) (*in portuguese*) are the best ways to start using it. Access our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/titan-framework) to learn advanced features and answer questions.

Troubleshoot
------------

* If after "vagrant up" you receive a error of Titan's CORE not found, try pause your antvirus, destroy VM (with "vagrant destroy") and make up again (I had problems with Kaspersky).
